# IntegratedReactorModel

**February 13th 2:21pm**
Uploading integrated reactor model mid depletion debugging. This also includes the side-by-side pincell version, and a simplified version for jiankai (not to work with).

Cross sections and ENDF depletion chains are not uploaded here and need to be uploaded seperatley

This will be used to create the full integrated model and debug it.

**February 14th 8:47pm**
Depletion curves now agree with Sarah's after modelling her reactor geometry and material inputs (they weren't thermo-mechanically calculated, just assumed 100C everywhere)

Material files updated to include MgO reflector

Depletion file structured to create better neutron source term for pins and plates and assembelies
